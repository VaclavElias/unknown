# Title - To be Decided
An application which brings some life literally to your boring web application.

Inspired by https://github.com/Auz/Bug

Phase 1 - Prototype Creation
- refactoring from JavaScript to Typescript
- using the "best" practises, Interfaces, Classes, Inheritance, naming 
- using comments to describe Classes,
- making a generic classes and using interfaces with easy to add different kind of entities in the future phases e.g. ants, ladybug, butterfly and also not living entities a car, robot, anything 
- creating a basic documentation in markdown format (md), how to use library, including how the animation sprite works
- adding custom behaviours to the entities so any entity can do whatever is added to it e.g. flying, moving, .. 
- the finished product can be used by using the Typescript files or compiling them into one JavaScript file.
- I recommend to use free Visual Studio Code or free Visual Studio Community Edition which both are easy to work with TypeScript

Phase 2 - Adding new, additional graphics and relevant behaviour and new fun entity behaviours, maybe using SVG images

Phase 3 - New Feature, Using ASP.NET Core + SignalR to move entities form one screen to another screen.
